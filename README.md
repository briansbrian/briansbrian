### 👋🏾 About
I’m Brian mK. I merge technology, creativity, and community impact.  
I build lightweight AI‑assisted productivity tools (fast capture, overlays, structured reasoning helpers) while deepening skills in cybersecurity & digital forensics.  
Psychology curiosity helps me design tools that reduce cognitive load instead of adding noise.  
Sustainability matters to me—what I do with code parallels what I do with materials: refine, reuse, repurpose.

### 🔭 Focus Areas
- Ambient / overlay note & capture workflows
- Lightweight Python service layers & automation
- Cross‑platform prototyping (Flutter + native Android)
- Small AI reasoning helpers (context structuring, summarization)
- Cybersecurity & digital forensics learning path
- Ethical tech & responsible augmentation
- Sustainable maker ethos (ThakaraBracelet)

---

### 🧰 Core Stack
Python · Dart (Flutter) · Kotlin · TypeScript  
+ HTML / lightweight frontend patterns

---

### 🛠 Representative Work (Abstracted)
- Overlay + capture ecosystem (private + public components)
- Modular backend services for note/reasoning flows
- Small data & conversion utilities
- Sustainability-driven wearable project (ThakaraBracelet)
- Early experiments in secure handling & context hygiene (for future forensics tooling)

---

### 🌱 Currently Learning
Cybersecurity fundamentals · Digital Forensics workflows · Advanced Flutter architecture · Responsible AI prompt + context design

---

### 🧩 Principles
Ship small. Stay clear. Remove steps.  
Augment—not distract.  
Sustainability applies to systems, habits, and materials.  
Ethics is a feature, not an afterthought.

---

### 🌍 Impact Threads
- Reducing friction between thought → captured, structured note
- Encouraging mindful use of AI (explainable, scoped, reversible)
- Upcycling waste into meaningful wearable narratives
- Exploring defensible, privacy‑respecting design choices
